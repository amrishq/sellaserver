        "description": "Written by Helen Disney, CEO of Unblocked Trust in the institutions that make up civil society â€“ be it politics, business, the media, NGOs or even academic expertise â€“ is in rapid decline. In the USA, Edelmanâ€™s most recent Trust Barometer showed a record-breaking drop in trust among the general public, much of it driven by a lack of faith in government. Trust in government fell 14 points to 33% among the general population and by 30 points to 33% among the â€˜informed publicâ€™. One tongue-in-cheek survey from 2013 found that Congress was less popular than head lice, root canal treatment and colonoscopies. Clearly something needs to change in the citizenâ€™s relationship with the state â€“ so could technology help? Could new decentralised ledger technologies restore trust and make the manipulation of elections, which has taken place in 52 countries over the past 5 years, a thing of the past? Much has been made of the potential of blockchain as an unchangeable source of shared truth â€“ a so-called â€˜trust layer of the internetâ€™ â€“ but how realistic is it to imagine that one day we may be able to eliminate the ghost of the â€˜hanging chadsâ€™ and see our elections conducted in this way? There are a number of areas where blockchain or distributed ledger technologies could potentially be useful in improving the electoral systems we have today including improving security, verifying identity and preventing fraud and also extending the vote to those who currently find it too difficult to physically visit a polling station or even get to a post box to send a postal vote. You may be surprised to know that there are 1.8bn people registered to vote today who donâ€™t actually exercise their democratic rights. What if you could vote by simply using an app on your phone? Surely many more people would be encouraged to get involved in elections if voting was as simple as many of the other consumer transactions we already engage in online today? Tech Radar has identified voting as one of the â€œ10 sectors that blockchain will disrupt foreverâ€�. And, in fact, a number of real world pilots of blockchain-based voting have already been carried out. As early as 2016, in Colombia, the non-profit foundation Democracy Earth launched a blockchain voting platform called Digital Plebiscite to allow Colombians abroad to cast votes regarding a Peace plebiscite conducted through the platform. In March this year, in what was initially reported as a global breakthrough it was claimed that Sierra Leone had employed blockchain technology in its Presidential elections. Later Sierra Leoneâ€™s National Electoral Commission (NEC) denied the claims and the CEO of blockchain foundation Agora, Leonardo Gammar, clarified that a pilot was instead run alongside the normal electoral process as a demonstration of how the election could be conducted using blockchain technology in future. Gammar claims the Sierra Leone NEC is nevertheless still keen to have Agora back for blockchain voting pilots in forthcoming by-elections. In the US, in May this year, West Virginia became the first state to allow Internet voting by blockchain in primary elections. This pilot also employed only a small number of voters but was nevertheless an interesting development. Kevin C. Desouza and Kiran Kabtta Somvanshi who wrote about the pilot in an article for the US think tank the Brookings Institution argue that â€œThe idea of using blockchain for elections is worth more than just an experiment, however. Mobile voting using a safe and tested interface could eliminate voter fraud and boost turnout. It will make it more convenient for citizens to vote while abroad, irrespective of the distance and time. It is also a beneficial tool for the election commission to maintain transparency in the electoral process, minimise the cost of conducting elections, streamline the process of counting votes and ensure that all votes are countedâ€�. In addition to state-run pilots, a number of organisations are getting involved in the push for distributed ledger voting. Hedera Hashgraph recently launched its Free & Fair Voting Initiative, which has the stated intention of making voting around the world as easy as picking up your phone. Hedera aims to eliminate voter manipulation and suppression from elections all over the world. It would work by verifying your identity on a mobile device and securely casting a vote on the Hedera distributed ledger. Votes would be anonymous and unable to be tampered with. Identity could be verified on your smartphone either via a fingerprint or retina scan. And in an interesting thought experiment using the technology to show rather than tell citizens what blockchains could do, an organisation called Decenturion, which is a digital nation state run on direct democracy and based on blockchain, is holding its 2nd Congress for 3000 of its quarter of a million citizens to explore the ideas behind â€˜the states of a new generationâ€™. Outside of politics, e-voting on a blockchain also has significance for the corporate world too. In January 2017, for example, the Estonian division of Nasdaq successfully completed testing of an e-voting system designed for shareholders of a company. Such systems have the potential to save money, reduce fraud and increase trust and transparency in business as well as in the public sector. Yet there are a number of hurdles to overcome before voting based on distributed systems becomes mainstream. Some cyber security experts argue that the risks of hacking involved in internet voting are just too great and there is still resistance among government officials in viewing blockchain as anything other than a new, relatively untested and thus risky proposition, with all the political fallout that an electronic voting failure would entail. Step one would seem to involve proving that distributed ledger technologies can succeed in improving the experience voters have in electing their political leaders today. But step two may be even more significant, ushering in a new era of more direct democracy and political processes in which citizens have a more direct stake in how they are governed. It seems that...

        "description": "The Century Club Soho played host to the Fintech Timesâ€™ very own HODL Your Nerve networking event and panel yesterday, with the future of cryptocurrency topping the agenda. On the third floor of the discreet little venue, up and away from a rain sodden Shaftesbury Avenue, slowly filling up with theatre-goers, the setting lent the occasion an almost conspiratorial feel. Our speakers â€“ Rudolfs Medvedevs, Mark Noorlander and Luigi Piva â€“ guests and moderator Troy Norcross huddled (or should that be HODLed) together cosily in the Centuryâ€™s Green Room and addressed some of the most pressing issues facing the sector today. Whilst the panel came to the discussion from different directions they were able to reach consensus on two pivotal issues with relative ease. The first was the fate of the initial coin offering. It seems that, according to this trio, the days of the ICO as we know it are numbered. The second wave of agreement came when the need for regulation was discussed as, converse to what hardcore crypto purists would have us believe, thereâ€™s a real desire to see the governments of the world legitimise blockchain technologies through legislation. After host Norcross (Co-Founder of Blockchain Rookies) had helpfully cleared up any confusion relating the the origin of the verb to HODL â€“ a typo turned GIF which now stands for Hold On for Dear Life â€“ the festivities could get under wayâ€¦ On the unsustainable growth and subsequent decline of the ICO market in 2018, Medvedevs, Co-Founder of the Ternion exchange said; â€œwhen my Grandma starts talking about cryptocurrencies, and actually asking me questions, you know thereâ€™s something wrong with the marketâ€� Luigi Piva of Elpis Investments used a similar homily from his homeland to illustrate what he referred to as the â€œtypical investors cycleâ€� which has come to characterise the market this year; â€œWe used to have a saying in Italy that when you hear housewives next door talking about stocks, run to the bank and sell everythingâ€� When asked what developments heâ€™d like to see in 2019, Noorlander of blockchain development outfit Flashboys, didnâ€™t deliberate for long before asserting that whatever form new innovations take, â€œit only works when it is fully backed or supported by a governmentâ€�, clarifying his stance by adding, â€œI believe in government regulation.â€� Towards the end of the discussion, talk turned to the kinds of instruments that may replace the much maligned ICO and the panel again chimed in unison that something closer to traditional IPOs, with their mainstream credibility, were a logical successor. Noorlander commented that, from his companyâ€™s perspective; â€œwe find it positiveâ€¦weâ€™ve had a discussion with the Maltese government and they are actually supporting this at a high level, creating IPOs based on tokenisationâ€� Piva concurred, adding; â€œI totally agree, the way things are moving now, most likely, this big change is a good changeâ€� As our guests finished their drinks and filed out into the overcast October night they may have found themselves pondering a similar predicament to the one faced by Kenny Rogers in his hit The Gambler. It appears that, when it comes to ICOs, you gotta know when to HODL â€™em, know when to fold â€™em, know when to walk away and know when to run. Whilst I donâ€™t think any HODL Your Nerve attendees will feel like running just yet, a few will consider folding and a few more might even be getting ready to walk away.

        "description": "Densify, the Cloud Optimisation software company, today launched Cloe Aware, the industryâ€™s first cloud optimisation-as-code product. Dedicated to bringing cloud costs dramatically down while improving application performance, Cloe Aware enables applications to self-optimise. Leveraging the industryâ€™s first optimisation-as-code product, Cloud operations teams can automate application optimisation by simply adding one line of code into their infrastructure-as-code template. Application demands can fluctuate every day, hour, and minute of the week. In parallel, cloud offerings, such as a compute instances can be purchased and configured in millions of different ways, and new technologies are introduced on a monthly basis. Itâ€™s impossible to align application needs with the right cloud technologies available while optimising each dollar spent. Densify analyses cloud usage patterns, proactively makes applications self-aware of their resource needs â€“ matching application needs to available cloud resources. Densifyâ€™s new product, Cloe Aware, represents a major leap forward in cloud optimisation. By adding one line of code into an infrastructure-as-code template, that application is not only self-aware but now self-optimising. â€œCloe Aware represents an important technical leap as the first product in the industry to allow companies to build optimisation-as-code into their cloud operations. With one line of code, their apps can now be automatically and forever optimised,â€� said Gerry Smith, CEO, Densify. A single line of code entered into the â€˜infrastructure-as-codeâ€™ templates such as Terraform, cloud-forms and cloud-formation tools, dynamically calls on Cloe Aware 24/7 â€“ this not only gives the cloud instances self-awareness of their cloud resources needs, based on business and application demands, but also the ability to automatically self-optimise. This means that the cloud instances on which the application runs are now able to automatically and dynamically change in the cloud â€“ driving improved application performance and lowering cloud spend. Product benefits include: A single line of code to fully automate cloud optimisation â€“ without requiring any user interface functionality â€“ making it simple and easy to bring cloud optimisation to the DevOps and TechOps teams Automatic generation of both machine-readable and human-readable output, enabling approval processes, flexible business intelligence reports and integration into Github or other repositories of choice Full automation based on Cloeâ€™s patented AI engine that finds the right cloud technology fit for each application Proactive optimisation improves application, and ultimately business, stability and performance Self-awareness of cloud resources shows exactly the risk and wasted spend in cloud, and where improvements should be made without any degradation to application performance, and self-optimisation provides the ability to take the action to make changes Operational efficiency is delivered by allowing all DevOps and TechOps teams to come together and leverage automated mechanism in selecting the right cloud resources every time, for every application The post Densify Launches Cloud Industryâ€™s First Optimisation-as-Code Product appeared first on The Fintech Times.",

        "description": "Alternative business lender Fleximize reveals it is on course for a record-breaking 2018 after almost doubling its lending to entrepreneurs between Q2 â€“ Q3 of this year. In a trailblazing quarter, Fleximize increased the total amount lent to businesses by more than 45 per cent. Proving entrepreneurial drive in the UK is still high â€“ despite mounting uncertainty â€“ the company saw a rise in its average loan size from Â£50.7k to Â£60.7k and a total increase demand in applications up almost 12 per cent in Q3. Sectors to note for this growth in Q3 include the construction industry which saw a 91.2 per cent increase in loans deployed, accommodation with 38.1 per cent, and Information and Communication following with a 44.5 per cent increase.4 Since launching four years ago, Fleximize has lent over Â£85 million to British SMEs off its own balance sheet and the company is well on track to hit its goal of lending more than Â£100 million to SMEs by the close of 2018. Peter Tuvey, co-founder and managing director of Fleximize, said: â€œOur consistent growth is testament to the hands-on, hard-working and dedicated entrepreneurs supporting the UK economy and weâ€™ve become a necessary part of their success stories. Tuvey continued, â€œThe significant rise in lending we have seen in the construction and accommodation sectors prove there is still demand for property development in the UK. As for the Information and Communication industries, Iâ€™m glad to say weâ€™re part of the technological innovations happening in Britain and weâ€™re helping turn these businesses into a reality. â€œWe want to continue doing right by entrepreneurs, especially in a time of such unease in the UK. This has been a very exciting year for Fleximize so far and weâ€™re well on track for achieving what once seemed like a hugely ambitious target.â€� The post UKâ€™s SME Ambitions Remain High as Alternative Business Lender has Record-Breaking 2018 appeared first on The Fintech Times.",

        "description": "InsurTech is one of the largest and most active sectors within the FinTech space. According to FinTech Global, over $7bn has been invested in InsurTech solution providers since 2015 as insurance companies and investors look to benefit from the huge impact new digital models will have on the industry. Established financial institutions are grappling with the challenges of rapid innovation and digital transformation as they attempt to understand which companies will have the most impact on their industry and which ones could become future partners or competitors. The InsurTech 100 identifies 100 of the companies that every leader in the insurance industry needs to know about in 2019. The companies on the list were selected by a panel of analysts and industry experts who reviewed a long list produced from thousands of InsurTech company profiles on the extensive database managed by FinTech Global, a data and research firm. Companies making the final cut were recognised for their innovative use of technology to solve a significant industry problem, or to generate cost savings or efficiency improvements across the insurance value chain. More than half of the InsurTech 100 companies are located in the UK or US, but the emergence of a thriving global InsurTech ecosystem has seen another 22 countries make the list. France, India, Singapore and Germany, which claim 17 companies between them on the InsurTech 100, have already established themselves as insurance entrepreneurship hubs. Other countries, large and small, are also beginning to make their mark in the industry, with Brazil, Sweden, South Africa, Netherlands, Australia and Hong Kong all represented. â€œThe impact of the most innovative InsurTech companies will be measured in billions of dollars over the next few years,â€� says Richard Sachar, a director of FinTech Global. â€œInsurTech 100 companies offer solutions that enhance functions across the entire insurance value chain, including marketing & distribution, underwriting & risk rating, claims and customer retention, and they incorporate the latest technologies, such as big data analytics, blockchain, artificial intelligence, the internet of things and bot-assistants.â€� The post Leading Innovators in Insurance Industry Announced in InsurTech 100 List appeared first on The Fintech Times.",

        "description": "A VITAL community fundraising event is due to run as smooth as silk thanks to the generous support of a London tech firm. WM Reply, experts in enhancing collaborative tools and business systems platforms for large organisations, will be supporting Notting Hill Genesisâ€™ (made up of Notting Hill Housing and Genesis Housing Association) â€˜A5 Showâ€™. The firm will do this by providing their technical services free of charge to ensure the exhibitionâ€™s website, which will enable people to purchase the different artworks, runs smoothly. The community exhibition gives creative residents and staff the chance to have their work displayed alongside professional artists, with all items displayed anonymously until it is purchased for the set price of Â£50. All proceeds from the sale of artworks will go towards The Tenant Hardship fund, which supports the most vulnerable tenants living in Notting Hill Genesis communities. With the majority of artworks expected to be purchased through the dedicated website, it was vital for Notting Hill Genesis to be sure the system would not fail. So when the opportunity came, they gladly accepted the specialist services of WM Reply to stress test the online portal free of charge â€“ a service that would normally have cost thousands. Richard Acreman, Partner at WM Reply, said: â€œThe Resident Art Show is a fantastic event showcasing the creativity of the community it also aims to help. Itâ€™s an honour for us to be part of such a worthy cause, so we were just happy to help in whatever way we could.â€� Mandy Worster, volunteer programme manager for Notting Hill Genesis, said: â€œEveryone involved is really looking forward to the A5 Show and giving our extremely talented residents the chance to display their work to a wider audience. Having a website we know works well and can help us raise money for such a good cause is vital, and we are extremely grateful to WM Reply for becoming one of our sponsors and providing such an important and efficient service.â€� The post Community Fundraising Event Supported by Donated Tech Services appeared first on The Fintech Times.",

        "description": "A new study from Juniper Research has found that revenues generated by the use of MaaS (Mobility-as-a-Service) platforms, which integrate multi-modal transport services (including buses, taxis, rail and metro), will exceed $11 billion by 2023. This is up from an estimated $100 million in 2018 and is an average annual growth of 156%. For more insights, download the free whitepaper: Why Mobility-as-a-Service is the Future of City Transport. The new research, Mobility-as-a-Service: Emerging Opportunities, Vendor Strategies & Market Forecasts 2018-2023, found that increased regulatory pressures for joined-up, environmentally sustainable and financially affordable transport options resulted in the emergence of MaaS platforms, as demonstrated by Moovel and Whim. It found that MaaS implementation will be further driven by the emerging focus on smart city initiatives. However, implementation of an open data policy is required immediately to realise this vision. Juniper forecasts that the total number of MaaS users will reach 10 million by 2023, as pilots become compelling service offerings. Fuel Cost Savings to Drive MaaS Growth Alongside top-down â€˜push factorsâ€™, user adoption will be further encouraged by cost-savings acting as a â€˜pull factorâ€™. Juniper forecasts that fuel cost savings from MaaS implementation will reach over $32 billion in 2023, up from just $210 million in 2018. Research author Nick Maynard explained: â€œCommuters face a compelling proposition in MaaS, which promises to reduce journey time and generate significant savings. However, service providers will require time to establish the trust needed to sustain successful challenges to traditional transport paradigms.â€� Competition to Intensify The research also found that emergent MaaS platforms will increasingly have to compete with ride-sourcing vendors, such as Uber, Lyft and DiDi Chuxing, which are expanding their offerings by integrating public transport options into their apps. This means that, in order to succeed, MaaS must offer a superior multimodal experience as well as financial incentives, which will require existing transport providers support, alongside city co-operation and legislative backing. Without these factors in place, MaaS will lack the elements which differentiate it from traditional transport, leading to poor adoption.

With 13 patents pending or issued, Aquiire extends Coupaâ€™s capability to deliver a comprehensive business-to-business (B2B) shopping experience spanning real-time, cached, and localised catalog search. Today, without real-time search capability, employees often waste precious time and productivity navigating catalogs across many different supplier websites to find the products they need. With Aquiireâ€™s patented technology part of the Coupa BSM Platform, employees can get all the information they need across suppliers in real-time with one instant search. This instant search allows for real-time competitive shopping, which can lower price as well as improve overall employee productivity. â€œOur goal is to transform how businesses manage spend. Our innovations combined with Aquiire provides the flexibility of real-time, cached, and localised search in the hands of every employee so they can spend smarter,â€� said Rob Bernshteyn, chief executive officer at Coupa. â€œIâ€™m excited to welcome the Aquiire team to Coupa. Together, we will continue building the most comprehensive and user-centric BSM platform in the world and deliver real value to businesses everywhere.â€� â€œOur technology truly delivers on the promise of real-time universal shopping that delivers businesses value and savings,â€� said Mike Palackdharry, president and CEO at Aquiire. â€œWe are thrilled to join Coupa and be another integral part of their business spend management offering that is used by leading organisations around the world.â€� Aquiire is based in Cincinnati, Ohio and was backed by Vora Ventures. It was recently named to the â€œ50 to Watch 2018â€� list by Spend Matters. â€œCoupa is working to put significant distance between itself and its rivals by using more modern approaches to access B2B supplier catalogs,â€� said Xavier Olivera, director of procure-to-pay research at Spend Matters. â€œOn the heels of buying Simeno for cached catalog search, the acquisition of Aquiire supports Coupaâ€™s strategy of delivering a consumerised B2B shopping experience using a Google-like catalog search, coupled with the compliance that businesses need. Given past performance, we expect Coupa will quickly embed Aquiireâ€™s patented, real-time search and advanced price comparison, providing an industry-unique shopping model and pricing intelligence.â€� The post Coupa Buys Real-Time Supplier Catalog Search, Aquiire appeared first on The Fintech Times.",

        "description": "Assaf Binstock, Co-Founder and CEO of credit scoring platform BeeEye, chatted to us in Tel Aviv about how the company is revolutionising money lending, and why Israel is such a hotbed of tech innovation. Tell us about BeeEye. What is it you are trying to do? First of all, what is a bank? A bank is an institution to which people give their trust â€“ itâ€™s got customers and means of distribution, and it has years of customer data stored up. Itâ€™s supposed to specialise in two things â€“ the selling of financial products, and risk evaluating for its customers. Beyond that, there is not much else. Weâ€™re coming from a place of combining the question of who the customers are with the quality of the underwriting which is given to them. Banks are still using relatively traditional sources for information â€“ unsophisticated and lacking in data, and, even though they often have the information internally, it stays buried in the basement and not used. Therefore, the decisions they end up making about their customers are not optimal. People who qualify for a loan donâ€™t get enough credit, and good people, who the bank can benefit from lending more money to, and they in turn can benefit from receiving more credit, are being left out. We come from this industry and we identified that we have the ability to take information and connect it to the customers the bank has. Whether itâ€™s connecting different information stores within the bank about a specific customers, or acquiring information from third party Introducing BeeEye sources or from the public web itself (like, for example, public information from the UK government). We then analyse all of the information and give a credit scoring based on it. So, the ability to create this model about all of the customers, and to explain how it all works and why certain decisions are reached (which is another thing we do), and to do it to scale for millions of people, that is what makes BeeEye different. Do you think this will contribute to financial inclusion? Yes. Credit is a vessel of social mobility â€“ itâ€™s a great thing. Thatâ€™s not the original purpose for which we set up the company, but it can certainly help. The startup and fintech scenes in Israel are very strong. What do you think are the contributing factors to this? I think there are two points that make Israeli engineers so unique. One is the high level of intellectual focus in the country â€“ education is very important. We have the Technion, and the army. Plus, a lot of people start gaining experience at a very young age â€“ thereâ€™s widespread early adoption for tech that comes into the country. Another thing is a lack of fear of breaking conventions, and the ability to try and find out whether things that didnâ€™t work elsewhere might work this time round. The combination of a good engineer, who has the professional know-how to do things without fear, creates a very good foundation for groundbreaking work. From an entrepreneurial perspective, itâ€™s easy to build up an early-stage startup here. Whatever field you can think of, there will be at least 10 companies doing really amazing things. So the infrastructureâ€™s good? Thereâ€™s support, funding, a sense of community? Thereâ€™s good early-stage funding â€“ there are a lot of private investors. Later, when you go into the growth stage, thereâ€™s an increasing number of funds available. That said, weâ€™re not necessarily looking for Israeli investors â€“ weâ€™re open to American, British and European funds. We also have Asian investors looking into our company. This kind of funding will help us with the next stage, which is expanding globally. What do you think the future of AI looks like? I believe more and more banks, credit card companies and lenders will adopt AI and machine learning technology, in order to perform smarter underwriting. As a result, the credit offer people will get will be more suitable to their abilities. This will eventually lead to a greater opportunity in the market for different players to receive credit, and the consumers are ultimately going to benefit from this. And the future of financial services as a whole? Do you think banks will disappear? No. I think for the foreseeable future, banks are the one that are going to manage money globally, not P2P networks. But they will go through a transformation, and will become organisations driven much more by data and technology, and less by physical branches, size and tradition. What the vision for BeeEye? The ability to bring the highest level of data-science technology to as many leading companies in the industry, and to upgrade the core of the banks with our technology. Itâ€™s a huge undertaking. It will take years, but it will be very significant. The post Co-Founder and CEO of BeeEye Talks Israeli Fintech, AI and the Nature of Modern Banking appeared first on The Fintech Times.",

        "description": "The Railsbank Hackathon last year was such a success, that the UK-based open-banking and RegTech platform is about to do it again. We asked company co-founder and CEO Nigel Verdon why they invite over 100 coders, industry executives and FinTech entrepreneurs to gather for two-days of challenges and problem solving using the Railsbank Open Banking API. The event goes under the hashtag #OpenBankHack18 and the theme this year is â€˜anti-fraud.â€™ It will demonstrate how API technology can help identify rogue elements, and takes place in London on 23 to 25 November, 2018. Nigel explained the background. â€œWe started our Hackathon last year and we were slightly apprehensive about organising such an event, because you never know what the reaction will be until people turn up on the day. â€œThe thing is, we have a reputation for putting ourselves out there, and the response to the Hackathon idea was superb. Our challenge resonated with many groups inside and outside of the industry and to coin a cliche, we all had a great time. Which is why we have made it an annual event, one which has already etched itself into the FinTech calendar.â€� But given the resources it takes to organise such events, what does Railsbank gain from its Hackathon? â€œWe gain a huge amount from the event and remember, our mission is to empower innovators to create a better financial world. This is the lynch-pin of that ambition. Itâ€™s a chance to have some of the best minds in the business work with our open banking API, the five lines of code on which this business was built. It brings together some of the industryâ€™s best brains and thinkers. Itâ€™s our chance to get together and brainstorm FinTech. We donâ€™t really need any more reason than thatâ€� Do you attract sponsors to the event? â€œWe do and this year weâ€™re very pleased to have on board two great FinTech sector heavyweights, Austrian-based RegTech firm, kompany, and Aprexo, a financial technology firm which specialises in investment management software. Itâ€™s great to have these two on board and their senior technical executives, kompany co-founder and CTO Peter Bainbridge-Clayton and Aprexo CTO Andy Thomas, will join our own Adam McGreggor, Chief Platform Officer to form part of the judging panel.â€� kompany provides real-time access to audit-proof commercial register data, including company filings covering more than 100 million companies in 150+ jurisdictions for customer onboarding (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML), enhanced due diligence (EDD) and ongoing compliance processes. Aprexo produces specialist software for the fund management business. Aprexoâ€™s hub is an Investment Book of Record (IBOR) with a modular API-driven design, supporting integration with proprietary software and with applications sold by other vendors. Also judging the Hackathon will be Nigel and Railsbank co-founder and COO Clive Mitchell, and Joanna Jenkins, the firmâ€™s Head of Compliance, and a global commentator on financial fraud. The #OpenBankHack18 takes place at the University of Greenwich, London, and the participants form teams and collaborate with mentors (senior FinTech sector entrepreneurs and executives) to create solutions to challenges based around tackling financial crime; taking compliance manuals from the world of paper into the world of digital; and, building a challenger bank within 48 hours. Last word to Nigel. â€œWe have positioned ourselves as a pioneer when it comes tackling fraud via API innovation. The #OpenBankHack18 proves how seriously we take this issue and itâ€™s great to see what comes out from such a sustained look at the subject. Weâ€™re looking forward to another great event.â€� Register at https://www.railsbank.com/openbankhack18.

        "description": "The growth of mobile phone technology is opening access to financial services for in Kenya. Data indicates that most of the Kenyan population relies on financial technology (fintech) companies to access financial services. This represents a previously unbanked population who can now manage their money more efficiently. Analysis and data from Asoko Insight helps to understand the marketâ€™s fundamentals and performance. Financial technology solutions Kenya is among the fastest growing economies south of the Sahara. In fact, the country possesses one of the most dynamic financial sectors on the continent. Specifically, the launch of M-Pesa put the country on the world map as the frontrunner in mobile money solutions. The solution facilitates B2B and P2P payments over a mobile phone platform via a local service provider. The success of M-Pesa led to a plethora of fintech start-ups in the country and has since rippled out, spreading as far as Europe and the US. The rise of fintech has had a significant impact on the financial services landscape; today, the solution reaches many more Kenyans than traditional financial institutions. The fintech sector has seen exponential growth in the past two years. Available data indicates that fintech companies are the leading creditors to low-income segments of the Kenyan population. Any Kenyan with a smartphone can access a fintech loan in just a matter of seconds, creating a strong link between growth in telecommunications providersâ€™ data services and take up of mobile money offerings. Banking regulation aids fintech disruption However, an Asoko analysis observes that recent fintech growth has also been largely influenced by the regulatory environment for traditional lenders, which since 2016 has tightened conditions for credit access. The 2016 Banking Act caps the interest banks can charge for commercial loans at 4 percentage points above Central Bank Rate (CBR), the rate at which the Central Bank offers loans to commercial banks. Intended to make credit more affordable, the cap has instead acted to curtail bank lending, particularly to high-risk creditors who make up a substantial proportion of would-be customers. This in turn has increased the flow of customers to fintech lenders, which are designed with the needs of â€œunbankableâ€� populations in mind. Vulnerabilities At the same time, increased competition from the fintech sector has led the banks to launch their own fintech solutions. Almost all of the top-tier commercial banks now have a fintech arm to cater for previously inaccessible client groups. Provision of fintech solutions also brings a unique set of challenges. Operating over the internet makes fintech particularly vulnerable to technological glitches and cybercrime. Current research indicates that most of the fintech companies do not have proper defences in place to protect their services and their users against a data breach. Upcoming regulation offers the opportunity to address these needs. Despite the challenges, fintech providers have changed the way financial services are accessed in Kenya and represent a market to watch as new opportunities for further disruption and innovation arise.

        "description": "CryptoCompare, the global cryptocurrency market data provider, has published the â€˜Cryptoasset Taxonomy Reportâ€™. The taxonomy provides retail and institutional investors, regulators and the industry as a whole with an independent classification of cryptoassets, based on the depth, breadth and scope of CryptoCompareâ€™s global datasets. More than 1,000 different cryptoassets have emerged in the last year alone. Each of these cryptoassets can be categorised and understood using numerous frameworks. There is a clear requirement for a unified approach on how to categorise these assets, to make well-informed investment decisions. In line with CryptoCompareâ€™s rigorous data standards, the taxonomy represents a detailed analysis of 200+ cryptoassets, based on more than 30 unique attributes, covering a range of economic, legal and technological features. CryptoCompare analysed the classification of cryptoassets from a variety of perspectives, including: existing natural cryptoasset groupings; regulatory classifications; access and governance; market cap and volume data; level of decentralisation; generation, distribution and supply concentration, to name but a few. The taxonomy also offers a summary classification â€“ the CryptoCompare Archetypes. This reflects what CryptoCompare considers the most natural grouping of cryptoassets at this moment in time. Charles Hayter, CEO and Founder of CryptoCompare, said: â€œDaily, retail and institutional investment communities express an appetite to invest and develop investment products and instruments based on cryptoassets. Key to this is the demand for a single, independent and trustworthy taxonomy offering transparency, consistency and confidence.â€� He added: â€œBased on our deep understanding of the cryptocurrency space and the breadth and integrity of our data, we are confident that this taxonomy will help industry participants, as well as regulators, gain a better understanding of the cryptocurrency landscape. In this nascent but fast evolving industry, we aim to offer the clarity required to navigate the complex crypto markets, helping all investors benefit from our experience and insights, and make well informed investment decisions.â€� Simon Taylor, Founder of Global Digital Finance & Co-Founder 11:FS, commented: â€œGlobal Digital Finance (GDF) has worked directly with global policy makers and standards bodies, to help bring a clearer understanding of the opportunities and risks that arise from cryptoassets. Itâ€™s clear language is one of the key challenges, given a word can have many meanings to many different professions. Indeed the simple use of â€œcurrencyâ€� can cause concern when used instead of â€œpaymentâ€�. By using the right terms, and by using shared language we can build a shared understanding of the significant potential cryptoassets will bring to the global economy. The work by CryptoCompare is the most detailed taxonomy to date and we look forward to future collaborations.â€� Jack Tatar, Managing Partner, Doyle Capital Management,said: â€œThe taxonomy that was defined in â€˜Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investorâ€™s Guide to Bitcoin and Beyondâ€™ was intended to create a foundational basis for further study. CryptoCompareâ€™s â€˜Cryptoasset Taxonomy Reportâ€™ provides a step forward in defining this space through its thoughtful, detailed and exhaustive research that incorporates lessons learned and current thinking since the publication of our book. Itâ€™s heartening to see the hard work and effort undertaken to further define the taxonomy of cryptoassets and rewarding to recognise that bright minds are pursuing this topic. Whatâ€™s been produced here is such a high-quality report that will allow others to build upon whatâ€™s provided here.â€� Gabor Gurbacs, Director, Digital Asset Strategy VanEck/MVIS, added: â€œVanEckâ€™s MVIS is committed to supporting greater standardisation and transparency in digital asset taxonomy. The proposed taxonomy is transparent, follows industry classification standards and has incorporated views from a wide range of market participants, regulators and academics. We have worked closely with CryptoCompare, MVISâ€™ core partner in digital asset data and indexing, as well as GDF and wish to see this classification standard adopted widely.â€� Leon Marshall, lead author and senior adviser, commented: â€œIâ€™m incredibly proud of the bottom-up research that our team has undertaken for this taxonomy. As the cryptoasset space matures, I am confident that our taxonomy can be used both as an intellectual framework and as a foundation for additional research. In addition, I am also grateful to Chris Burniske, Felipe Pereira, Ari Paul, Thomas Linder, John Pfeffer, Eitan Jankelewitz, Michael Jackson, Simon Taylor, Jesse McWaters, Teana-Baker-Taylor, Eric Wall and Max Mersch for sharing their considered thoughts and time with us.â€� The post CryptoCompare Publishes Cryptoasset Taxonomy appeared first on The Fintech Times.",
